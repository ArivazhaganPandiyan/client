## Frontend Source Code Structure

The frontend source code consists of several components and pages:

- **App.jsx**: Main component rendering the application's routes using React Router.
- **auth.jsx**: Page containing components for user authentication, including login and registration.
- **create-recipe.jsx**: Page allowing users to create new recipes with details such as name, ingredients, instructions, and cooking time.
- **home.jsx**: Page displaying a list of recipes fetched from the server, along with options to save and delete recipes.
- **saved-recipes.jsx**: Page displaying a list of recipes saved by the user.

## Installation and Setup

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
